# SimpleFinanceCalculatorPython
A simple personal finance Calculator in Python

This is a simple expandable personal (for school) Finance Calculator.

This was an indidivdual skills assesment assignment.  The objective here was to learn a new skill.
I picked up most of this via codecademy.com.  It is a great learning tool.

The code here is not perfect.  I was kinda washy on some of OOP conventions.  But it works and does what I think it is supposed to.
